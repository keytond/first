my first reflections

installed vim
installed notepad++
installed git so i can use the git bash in windows
tools I use at work a bit but haven't used at home
I'm getting nerdier all the time

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Neat! I finally learned how to paste into vim from the clipboard. +p

And how to copy a line from vim to the clipboard. +y   I copied and pasted this line:

Good explanation of commits in Git. Seems like it would be useful for some of 
my projects at work but I don't think my tools interact with it very well. It'd
be an extra, separate step for every commit.

thoughts about commits that include multiple files. sounds like a nice way
to compare code repositories

git log shows the versions of repos saved at different times

git diff runs a diff against any files in the listed commits

there's a handy command to color your git diffs
git config --global color.ui auto

a great example of using version control to find bugs
and super handy to have confidence that previous versions are available to roll back to when needed

it'd be nice to be comfortable enough with git (and vim) to use it for projects at work. 

so many unix/linux programs require custom configs before they're usable. 
it's nice to walk through the configurations with a video like this so I know
where we're headed and why
