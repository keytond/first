When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repos are great if you're editing a project from multiple devices or collaborating with others. They also give you offsite storage as a backup and make code more easily discoverable.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's always nice to have control over what's going where. If you're collaborating with other developers, you might not want to pull their code automatically. 
On large projects, you might only want to pull files that relate to your piece of the project.
